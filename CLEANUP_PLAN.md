# Claude Bot Infrastructure Cleanup Plan

This document outlines the comprehensive cleanup and hardening plan for the Claude Bot Infrastructure project.

## Overview

The Claude Bot Infrastructure has accumulated redundant code and potential failure points that need to be addressed to improve maintainability and reliability. This plan is divided into 4 phases, each focusing on specific improvements.

## Phase 1: Remove Redundant Code ✅ COMPLETED

**Goal**: Eliminate duplicate functionality and unused code to simplify maintenance.

### Tasks:
1. **✅ Remove GitHub Pages Dashboard** (`dashboard/` folder)
   - The self-hosted Flask dashboard in `status-web/` provides the same functionality
   - GitHub Pages implementation was redundant and unused

2. **✅ Remove Duplicate Docker Compose File** (`docker-compose.dotnet.yml`)
   - Functionality is already included in main `docker-compose.yml` with profiles
   - Having two files created confusion and maintenance overhead

3. **✅ Clean Up Status Reporter**
   - Removed GitHub publishing code from `scripts/status_reporter.py`
   - Kept only the web dashboard publishing functionality

4. **✅ Clean Up Start Script**
   - Removed debug echo statements from `scripts/start-bot.sh`
   - Kept only essential functionality

### Results:
- Removed ~300 lines of redundant code
- Simplified configuration and maintenance
- All functionality preserved through web dashboard

## Phase 2: Fix Critical Failure Points ✅ COMPLETED

**Goal**: Address container restart loops and permission issues.

### Tasks:
1. **✅ Fix Container Restart Loop**
   - **Issue**: `start-bot.sh` tries to clone into `/workspace` with permission issues
   - **Solution**: Mount project as volume instead of cloning
   - Updated docker-compose.yml to mount `${PROJECT_PATH}:/workspace`

2. **✅ Add Health Checks**
   - Implemented health check endpoints for all services
   - Configured Docker health checks with appropriate intervals

3. **✅ Fix Volume Permissions**
   - Ensured all volumes have correct ownership
   - Added init scripts to set permissions on startup

4. **✅ Line Ending Fixes**
   - Added `.gitattributes` to control line endings consistently
   - Resolved merge conflicts caused by CRLF/LF differences

### Results:
- Containers start without restart loops
- Health checks provide proper monitoring
- No permission errors in logs
- Cross-platform compatibility resolved

## Phase 3: Enhance Error Handling

**Goal**: Add comprehensive error handling and recovery mechanisms.

### Tasks:
1. **Add Retry Logic**
   - Implement exponential backoff for API calls
   - Add retry mechanisms for transient failures

2. **Improve Logging**
   - Standardize log formats across all scripts
   - Add log rotation to prevent disk space issues
   - Include correlation IDs for tracking

3. **Add Circuit Breakers**
   - Prevent cascade failures
   - Implement graceful degradation

4. **Handle Edge Cases**
   - Empty queue scenarios
   - Invalid task formats
   - Network timeouts

### Verification:
- Test with various failure scenarios
- Verify proper error messages and recovery
- Check log output is consistent and helpful

## Phase 4: Production Readiness

**Goal**: Prepare the system for production deployment.

### Tasks:
1. **Externalize Configuration**
   - Move all hardcoded values to environment variables
   - Create comprehensive `.env.example`
   - Add configuration validation on startup

2. **Add Monitoring**
   - Implement Prometheus metrics
   - Add performance tracking
   - Create alerting rules

3. **Security Hardening**
   - Run containers as non-root users
   - Implement secrets management
   - Add rate limiting

4. **Documentation**
   - Create operational runbooks
   - Document troubleshooting procedures
   - Add architecture diagrams

### Verification:
- Full system test in production-like environment
- Security scan passes
- Documentation review complete

## Implementation Order

1. **✅ Phase 1** - Immediate cleanup (Low risk, high impact)
2. **✅ Phase 2** - Critical fixes (Medium risk, critical impact)
3. **🔄 Phase 3** - Error handling (Medium risk, high impact)
4. **⏳ Phase 4** - Production prep (Low risk, long-term impact)

## Success Criteria

- ✅ All containers start reliably without restart loops
- ✅ No redundant code or unused files
- ⏳ Comprehensive error handling and logging
- ⏳ Production-ready configuration and monitoring
- ⏳ Clear documentation for operations

## Notes

- Each phase should be completed and tested before moving to the next
- Create backups before making significant changes
- Monitor system behavior after each change
- Document any deviations from this plan

## Current Status

**Phases 1 & 2 are complete!** The infrastructure is now stable with:
- No container restart loops
- Clean, maintainable codebase
- Proper volume mounting and permissions
- Cross-platform line ending compatibility
- Health monitoring for all services
