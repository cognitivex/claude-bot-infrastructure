## 📊 **Evaluation Criteria**

Before implementing any feature, consider:

### **Value Assessment**
- ✅ **Problem Clarity**: Does it solve a real problem?
- ✅ **User Impact**: How many users benefit?
- ✅ **Effort vs Benefit**: Is the improvement worth the complexity?

### **Technical Feasibility**
- ✅ **Backward Compatibility**: Won't break existing setups
- ✅ **Maintenance Burden**: Can be maintained long-term
- ✅ **Security Implications**: Doesn't introduce vulnerabilities

### **Strategic Alignment**
- ✅ **Core Mission**: Aligns with bot automation goals
- ✅ **Resource Availability**: Team has capacity to implement
- ✅ **Technology Evolution**: Uses stable, supported technologies

## 🔬 **Validation Process**

### **For Major Features:**
1. **Research Phase**: Document requirements and design
2. **Prototype Phase**: Build minimal viable implementation
3. **Testing Phase**: Validate with real use cases
4. **Implementation Phase**: Full development and integration

### **For Minor Enhancements:**
1. **Issue Documentation**: Clear problem statement
2. **Solution Design**: Simple implementation approach
3. **Implementation**: Direct development
4. **Testing**: Validation with existing system
